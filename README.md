Wine Quality prediction 
In this project, our objective is to predict the quality of wine based on a set of given features. To accomplish this task, we utilize a freely available wine quality dataset from the Internet. The dataset contains essential features that significantly impact the overall quality of the wine.

By employing various machine learning models, we aim to build predictive models that can effectively assess and predict the quality of the wine. Through the analysis of the data and the use of these models, we seek to gain valuable insights into the factors influencing wine quality. The ultimate goal is to develop accurate and reliable predictions, enabling us to understand and evaluate the wine's overall quality based on its fundamental characteristics.
